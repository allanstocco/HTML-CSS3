                <h2>Whats that???</h2>
                <p><b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
                    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
                    rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
                    for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
                    delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt;
                    directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about
                    document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but
                    use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system
                    for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
                    Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server
                    software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
                    collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In
                    his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and
                    put an encyclopedia first.</p>

                <h2>Let us look at a few of the tags which were added to HTML5</h2>
                <table id="tabelaspec">
                    <caption>Tabela TÃ©cnica do Google Glass <span>Nov/2020</span></td>
                    </caption>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="ce">Email</td>
                        <td class="cd">New HTML5 tag, which was added, is the input element of type email. This is a
                            form tag, although it could be used outside of a form tag also. This tag checks the
                            validation of the input value. It checks whether the value inserted is a valid email.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td rowspan="2" class="ce">Audio Tag and Semantic Tags</td>
                        <td class="cd">This is a new audio tag that was implemented in HTML5. This tag helps to add
                            audio to our web page. We can use this tag to embed an audio clip into a web page. This
                            audio tag could be played on a webpage.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="cd">Semantic tags are also known as structural tags. Structural tags are the tags
                            that provide structure to the HTML page. It helps it divide the HTML page into different
                            structures. These structures get combined into an HTML page itself to form an HTML web page.
                            Few of the important HTML semantic tags are figcaption, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="ce">Password </td>
                        <td class="cd">This is another form tag that was added to receive a password from the user.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="ce">Section tag </td>
                        <td class="cd">This tag is used to semantic a section in an HTML page. A section tag represents
                            a section on a web page.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h2>Delivery</h2>
                <p>The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web
                    browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound,
                    and other content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document
                    it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This meta data usually
                    includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see
                    Character encoding in HTML).

                    In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is
                    initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be well-formed XML;
                    syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME
                    type might be displayed successfully, since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.</p>

                <h2>HTML Application</h2>
                <p>An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ".hta") is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML
                    and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file
                    is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers
                    and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application
                    and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry
                    entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via
                    HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.

            <h2>CSS features</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the
                process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page.</p>

            <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It
                allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small
                screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>
